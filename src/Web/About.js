              ,we were clear what basics we wanted in terms of design and
              importantly protect all 8 fruiting trees. He gave us a terrific
              design with a warm feel ,lots of light all around and almost

              Architects was one which we really believe was the best while
              building our dream home. We had quite a few requirements &
              constraints due to vaastu and yet wanted a very creative home with
              very little or in fact no scope for deviation. To add to it, our
              taste was a mix of vernacular and contemporary which brings in
              further complexity to the requirement. This in my opinion is very
              restrictive for a creative profession. I should say Naveen was
              very understanding and accommodative and yet very creative for
              that matter. He managed to design a home for us which was
              practical, as per every single requirement of vaastu for us and
              the best part, a right mix of contemporary and vernacular design!
              He always would present pros and cons of each option and helped us
              make an informed choice at every step. The outcome of his
              attention to detail and the way he partnered with us along the
              journey reflects directly in the final output, the feel good
              factor and the compliments we receive from friends and neighbors."
